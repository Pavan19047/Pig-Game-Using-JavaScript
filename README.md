#### :tada: RULES :tada::

* The game involves 2 players, each playing in turn
* During each turn, a player can roll a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their `ROUND` score.
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, their `ROUND` score is lost. After this, it's the next player's turn.
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means their `ROUND` score gets added to their `GLOBAL` score. After this, it's the next player's turn.
* The first player to reach 100 points on `GLOBAL` wins the game.
